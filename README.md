## This project is a clone of medium website using django/rest/react/styledComeponents stack

unfortunately, I have no time to update this readme, but I promise I will create a full readme DOC when project will be, at least 60% completed...
it's created as a training full stack project for my personal portfolio.... yeah, I have a plan on how to mod and use this later on! ....but for now it's just a demo


## tech stack:


I've planned to use react, django, postgreSQL, and some python machine learning deps that, currently, I'm not able to implement as I'm using a M1 macbook pro to develope all this.... ( PYTHON ML DEPS DOES NOT WORK QUITE WELL HERE.....  and, as I currently have no job, I can't buy a windows 10 laptop..... :(


### Please be aware that this is an open source training project, any comment and feedback will be highly appreciated
