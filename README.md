#This project is a clone of medium website using django/rest/react/styledComeponents stack

unfortunately, I have no time to update this readme, but I'll promise I will create a full readme DOC when project will be, at least 60% completed...
it's created as a training full stack project for my personal portfolio.... yeah, I have a plan on how to mod and use this later on! ....but for now it's just a demo


## tech stack:


I've planned to use react, django, postgreSQL, and some python machine learning deps that, currently I'm not able to implement, as I'm using a M1 macbook pro to develope all this.... (PANDAS AND OTHER ML DEPS DOES NOT WORK YET HERE.....  and, as I currently have no job, I can't buy parallel desktop or a windows machine to run windows 10 and develope all the rest of the ML from there.... :(


### Please be aware that this is an open source training project, any comment and feedback will be highly appreciated
